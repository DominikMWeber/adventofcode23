# Advent of Code 2023
My humble solutions for Advent of Code 2023.
I chose Python for it's simplicity. Still most of the code is not very 'pythonic', since I tried to focus on basic programming patterns every language offers without advanced libraries and modules. I also didn't care much about performance, it's just for fun!
```   *    *  ()   *   *
         * /\         *
      *   /i\\    *  *
    *     o/\\  *      *
 *       ///\i\    *
     *   /*/o\\  *    *
   *    /i//\*\      *
        /o/*\\i\   *
  *    //i//o\\\\     *
    * /*////\\\\i\*
 *    //o//i\\*\\\   *
   * /i///*/\\\\\o\   *
  *    *   ||     *
```
